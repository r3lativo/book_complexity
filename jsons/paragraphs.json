    "The most merciful thing in the world I think is the inability of the human\nmind to correlate all its contents We live on a placid island of ignorance in\nthe midst of black seas of infinity and it was not meant that we should\nvoyage far The sciences each straining in its own direction have hitherto\nharmed us little but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge\nwill open up such terrifying vistas of reality and of our frightful position\ntherein that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the\ndeadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age",
    "Theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein\nour world and human race form transient incidents They have hinted at strange\nsurvivals in terms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland\noptimism But it is not from them that there came the single glimpse of\nforbidden eons which chills me when I think of it and maddens me when I dream\nof it That glimpse like all dread glimpses of truth flashed out from an\naccidental piecing together of separated thingsin this case an old newspaper\nitem and the notes of a dead professor I hope that no one else will\naccomplish this piecing out certainly if I live I shall never knowingly\nsupply a link in so hideous a chain I think that the professor too intended\nto keep silent regarding the part he knew and that he would have destroyed\nhis notes had not sudden death seized him",
    "My knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 192627 with the death of my\ngranduncle George Gammell Angell Professor Emeritus of Semitic languages in\nBrown University Providence Rhode Island Professor Angell was widely known\nas an authority on ancient inscriptions and had frequently been resorted to\nby the heads of prominent museums so that his passing at the age of ninety\ntwo may be recalled by many Locally interest was intensified by the\nobscurity of the cause of death The professor had been stricken whilst\nreturning from the Newport boat falling suddenly as witnesses said after\nhaving been jostled by a nauticallooking negro who had come from one of the\nqueer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from\nthe waterfront to the deceaseds home in Williams Street Physicians were\nunable to find any visible disorder but concluded after perplexed debate that\nsome obscure lesion of the heart induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a\nhill by so elderly a man was responsible for the end At the time I saw no\nreason to dissent from this dictum but latterly I am inclined to wonderand\nmore than wonder",
    "As my granduncles heir and executor for he died a childless widower I was\nexpected to go over his papers with some thoroughness and for that purpose\nmoved his entire set of files and boxes to my quarters in Boston Much of the\nmaterial which I correlated will be later published by the American\nArcheological Society but there was one box which I found exceedingly\npuzzling and which I felt much averse from showing to other eyes It had been\nlocked and I did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine the\npersonal ring which the professor carried always in his pocket Then indeed\nI succeeded in opening it but when I did so seemed only to be confronted by a\ngreater and more closely locked barrier For what could be the meaning of the\nqueer clay basrelief and the disjointed jottings ramblings and cuttings\nwhich I found Had my uncle in his latter years become credulous of the most\nsuperficial impostures I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor\nresponsible for this apparent disturbance of an old mans peace of mind",
    "The basrelief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five by\nsix inches in area obviously of modern origin Its designs however were far\nfrom modern in atmosphere and suggestion for although the vagaries of cubism\nand futurism are many and wild they do not often reproduce that cryptic\nregularity which lurks in prehistoric writing And writing of some kind the\nbulk of these designs seemed certainly to be though my memory despite much\nfamiliarity with the papers and collections of my uncle failed in any way to\nidentify this particular species or even hint at its remotest affiliations",
    "Above these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evidently pictorial intent\nthough its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature\nIt seemed to be a sort of monster or symbol representing a monster of a form\nwhich only a diseased fancy could conceive If I say that my somewhat\nextravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus a dragon\nand a human caricature I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing\nA pulpy tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary\nwings but it was the general outline of the whole which made it most\nshockingly frightful Behind the figure was a vague suggestion of a Cyclopean\narchitectural background",
    "The writing accompanying this oddity was aside from a stack of press\ncuttings in Professor Angells most recent hand and made no pretense to\nliterary style What seemed to be the main document was headed  CTHULHU\nCULT  in characters painstakingly printed to avoid the erroneous reading of\na word so unheardof This manuscript was divided into two sections the first\nof which was headed 1925Dream and Dream Work of H A Wilcox 7 Thomas St\nProvidence R I and the second Narrative of Inspector John R Legrasse\n121 Bienville St New Orleans La at 1908 A A S MtgNotes on Same \nProf Webbs Acct The other manuscript papers were all brief notes some of\nthem accounts of the queer dreams of different persons some of them citations\nfrom theosophical books and magazines notably W ScottEliotts Atlantis and\nthe Lost Lemuria  and the rest comments on longsurviving secret societies\nand hidden cults with references to passages in such mythological and\nanthropological sourcebooks as Frazers Golden Bough and Miss Murrays\nillnesses and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of 1925",
    "\nThe first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar tale It\nappears that on March 1st 1925 a thin dark young man of neurotic and\nexcited aspect had called upon Professor Angell bearing the singular clay bas\nrelief which was then exceedingly damp and fresh His card bore the name of\nHenry Anthony Wilcox and my uncle had recognized him as the youngest son of\nan excellent family slightly known to him who had latterly been studying\nsculpture at the Rhode Island School of Design and living alone at the Fleur\ndeLys Building near that institution Wilcox was a precocious youth of known\ngenius but great eccentricity and had from childhood excited attention\nthrough the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating He\ncalled himself psychically hypersensitive but the staid folk of the ancient\ncommercial city dismissed him as merely queer Never mingling much with his\nkind he had dropped gradually from social visibility and was now known only\nto a small group of esthetes from other towns Even the Providence Art Club\nanxious to preserve its conservatism had found him quite hopeless",
    "On the occasion of the visit ran the professors manuscript the sculptor\nabruptly asked for the benefit of his hosts archeological knowledge in\nidentifying the hieroglyphics on the basrelief He spoke in a dreamy stilted\nmanner which suggested pose and alienated sympathy and my uncle showed some\nsharpness in replying for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet implied\nkinship with anything but archeology Young Wilcoxs rejoinder which\nimpressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim was of a\nfantastically poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation and\nwhich I have since found highly characteristic of him He said It is new\nindeed for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities and dreams are\nolder than brooding Tyre or the contemplative Sphinx or gardengirdled\nBabylon",
    "It was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a\nsleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle There had been a\nslight earthquake tremor the night before the most considerable felt in New\nEngland for some years and Wilcoxs imagination had been keenly affected\nUpon retiring he had had an unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean cities of\nTitan blocks and skyflung monoliths all dripping with green ooze and\nsinister with latent horror Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars\nand from some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice\na chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound but which he\nattempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters ",
    "This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed\nProfessor Angell He questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness and\nstudied with almost frantic intensity the basrelief on which the youth had\nfound himself working chilled and clad only in his nightclothes when waking\nhad stolen bewilderingly over him My uncle blamed his old age Wilcox\nafterward said for his slowness in recognizing both hieroglyphics and\npictorial design Many of his questions seemed highly out of place to his\nvisitor especially those which tried to connect the latter with strange cults\nor societies and Wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence\nwhich he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in some\nwidespread mystical or paganly religious body When Professor Angell became\nconvinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of\ncryptic lore he besieged his visitor with demands for future reports of\ndreams This bore regular fruit for after the first interview the manuscript\nrecords daily calls of the young man during which he related startling\nfragments of nocturnal imagery whose burden was always some terrible Cyclopean\nvista of dark and dripping stone with a subterrene voice or intelligence\nshouting monotonously in enigmatical senseimpacts uninscribable save as\ngibberish The two sounds most frequently repeated are those rendered by the\nletters  Cthulhu  and  Rlyeh ",
    "On March 23rd the manuscript continued Wilcox failed to appear and\ninquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure\nsort of fever and taken to the home of his family in Waterman Street He had\ncried out in the night arousing several other artists in the building and\nhad manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness and delirium\nMy uncle at once telephoned the family and from that time forward kept close\nwatch of the case calling often at the Thayer Street office of Dr Tobey\nwhom he learned to be in charge The youths febrile mind apparently was\ndwelling on strange things and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke\nof them They included not only a repetition of what he had formerly dreamed\nbut touched wildly on a gigantic thing miles high which walked or lumbered\nabout He at no time fully described this object but occasional frantic\nwords as repeated by Dr Tobey convinced the professor that it must be\nidentical with the nameless monstrosity he had sought to depict in his dream\nsculpture Reference to this object the doctor added was invariably a\nprelude to the young mans subsidence into lethargy His temperature oddly\nenough was not greatly above normal but the whole condition was otherwise\nsuch as to suggest true fever rather than mental disorder",
    "On April 2nd at about 3 p m every trace of Wilcoxs malady suddenly ceased\nHe sat upright in bed astonished to find himself at home and completely\nignorant of what had happened in dream or reality since the night of March\n22nd Pronounced well by his physician he returned to his quarters in three\ndays but to Professor Angell he was of no further assistance All traces of\nstrange dreaming had vanished with his recovery and my uncle kept no record\nof his nightthoughts after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of\nthoroughly usual visions",
    "\nHere the first part of the manuscript ended but references to certain of the\nscattered notes gave me much material for thoughtso much in fact that only\nthe ingrained skepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my\ncontinued distrust of the artist The notes in question were those descriptive\nof the dreams of various persons covering the same period as that in which\nyoung Wilcox had had his strange visitations My uncle it seems had quickly\ninstituted a prodigiously farflung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the\nfriends whom he could question without impertinence asking for nightly\nreports of their dreams and the dates of any notable visions for some time\npast The reception of his request seems to have been varied but he must at\nthe very least have received more responses than any ordinary man could have\nhandled without a secretary This original correspondence was not preserved\nbut his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest Average people\nin society and businessNew Englands traditional salt of the earthgave\nan almost completely negative result though scattered cases of uneasy but\nformless nocturnal impressions appear here and there always between March\n23rd and April 2ndthe period of young Wilcoxs delirium Scientific men were\nlittle more affected though four cases of vague description suggest fugitive\nglimpses of strange landscapes and in one case there is mentioned a dread of\nsomething abnormal",
    "It was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came and I know\nthat panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes As it\nwas lacking their original letters I half suspected the compiler of having\nasked leading questions or of having edited the correspondence in\ncorroboration of what he had latently resolved to see That is why I continued\nto feel that Wilcox somehow cognizant of the old data which my uncle had\npossessed had been imposing on the veteran scientist These responses from\nesthetes told a disturbing tale From February 28th to April 2nd a large\nproportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things the intensity of the\ndreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptors\ndelirium Over a fourth of those who reported anything reported scenes and\nhalfsounds not unlike those which Wilcox had described and some of the\ndreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless thing visible toward\nthe last One case which the note describes with emphasis was very sad The\nsubject a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and\noccultism went violently insane on the date of young Wilcoxs seizure and\nexpired several months later after incessant screamings to be saved from some\nescaped denizen of hell Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead\nof merely by number I should have attempted some corroboration and personal\ninvestigation but as it was I succeeded in tracing down only a few All of\nthese however bore out the notes in full I have often wondered if all the\nobjects of the professors questioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction\nIt is well that no explanation shall ever reach them",
    "The press cuttings as I have intimated touched on cases of panic mania and\neccentricity during the given period Professor Angell must have employed a\ncutting bureau for the number of extracts was tremendous and the sources\nscattered throughout the globe Here was a nocturnal suicide in London where\na lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking cry Here likewise a\nrambling letter to the editor of a paper in South America where a fanatic\ndeduces a dire future from visions he has seen A dispatch from California\ndescribes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some\nglorious fulfilment which never arrives whilst items from India speak\nguardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of March Voodoo orgies\nmultiply in Haiti and African outposts report ominous mutterings American\nofficers in the Philippines find certain tribes bothersome about this time\nand New York policemen are mobbed by hysterical Levantines on the night of\nMarch 2223 The west of Ireland too is full of wild rumor and legendry and\na fantastic painter named ArdoisBonnot hangs a blasphemous Dream Landscape\nin the Paris spring salon of 1926 And so numerous are the recorded troubles\nin insane asylums that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity\nfrom noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions A weird\nbunch of cuttings all told and I can at this date scarcely envisage the\ncallous rationalism with which I set them aside But I was then convinced that\nyoung Wilcox had known of the older matters mentioned by the professor",
    "",
    "The older matters which had made the sculptors dream and basrelief so\nsignificant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long\nmanuscript Once before it appears Professor Angell had seen the hellish\noutlines of the nameless monstrosity puzzled over the unknown hieroglyphics\nand heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as  Cthulhu \nand all this in so stirring and horrible a connection that it is small wonder\nhe pursued young Wilcox with queries and demands for data",
    "This earlier experience had come in 1908 seventeen years before when the\nAmerican Archeological Society held its annual meeting in St Louis Professor\nAngell as befitted one of his authority and attainments had had a prominent\npart in all the deliberations and was one of the first to be approached by\nthe several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation to offer questions\nfor correct answering and problems for expert solution",
    "The chief of these outsiders and in a short time the focus of interest for\nthe entire meeting was a commonplacelooking middleaged man who had traveled\nall the way from New Orleans for certain special information unobtainable from\nany local source His name was John Raymond Legrasse and he was by profession\nan inspector of police With him he bore the subject of his visit a\ngrotesque repulsive and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin\nhe was at a loss to determine",
    "It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the least interest in\narcheology On the contrary his wish for enlightenment was prompted by purely\nprofessional considerations The statuette idol fetish or whatever it was\nhad been captured some months before in the wooded swamps south of New Orleans\nduring a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting and so singular and hideous were\nthe rites connected with it that the police could not but realize that they\nhad stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them and infinitely more\ndiabolic than even the blackest of the African voodoo circles Of its origin\napart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured\nmembers absolutely nothing was to be discovered hence the anxiety of the\npolice for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful\nsymbol and through it track down the cult to its fountainhead",
    "Inspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering\ncreated One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of\nscience into a state of tense excitement and they lost no time in crowding\naround him to gaze at the diminutive figure whose utter strangeness and air of\ngenuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at unopened and archaic vistas\nNo recognized school of sculpture had animated this terrible object yet\ncenturies and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish\nsurface of unplaceable stone",
    "The figure which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and\ncareful study was between seven and eight inches in height and of\nexquisitely artistic workmanship It represented a monster of vaguely\nanthropoid outline but with an octopuslike head whose face was a mass of\nfeelers a scaly rubberylooking body prodigious claws on hind and fore\nfeet and long narrow wings behind This thing which seemed instinct with a\nfearsome and unnatural malignancy was of a somewhat bloated corpulence and\nsquatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable\ncharacters The tips of the wings touched the back edge of the block the seat\noccupied the center whilst the long curved claws of the doubledup\ncrouching hind legs gripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way\ndown toward the bottom of the pedestal The cephalopod head was bent forward\nso that the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge forepaws\nwhich clasped the crouchers elevated knees The aspect of the whole was\nabnormally lifelike and the more subtly fearful because its source was so\ntotally unknown Its vast awesome and incalculable age was unmistakable yet\nnot one link did it show with any known type of art belonging to\ncivilizations youthor indeed to any other time",
    "Totally separate and apart its very material was a mystery for the soapy\ngreenishblack stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striations\nresembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy The characters along the\nbase were equally baffling and no member present despite a representation of\nhalf the worlds expert learning in this field could form the least notion of\neven their remotest linguistic kinship They like the subject and material\nbelonged to something horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it\nsomething frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which\nour world and our conceptions have no part",
    "And yet as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at\nthe inspectors problem there was one man in that gathering who suspected a\ntouch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing and who\npresently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew This person was\nthe late William Channing Webb professor of anthropology in Princeton\nUniversity and an explorer of no slight note",
    "Professor Webb had been engaged fortyeight years before in a tour of\nGreenland and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptions which he failed to\nunearth and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast had encountered a\nsingular tribe or cult of degenerate Eskimos whose religion a curious form of\ndevilworship chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and\nrepulsiveness It was a faith of which other Eskimos knew little and which\nthey mentioned only with shudders saying that it had come down from horribly\nancient eons before ever the world was made Besides nameless rites and human\nsacrifices there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme\nelder devil or tornasuk  and of this Professor Webb had taken a careful\nphonetic copy from an aged angekok or wizardpriest expressing the sounds\nin Roman letters as best he knew how But just now of prime significance was\nthe fetish which this cult had cherished and around which they danced when\nthe aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs It was the professor stated a\nvery crude basrelief of stone comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic\nwriting And as far as he could tell it was a rough parallel in all essential\nfeatures of the bestial thing now lying before the meeting",
    "These data received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members\nproved doubly exciting to Inspector Legrasse and he began at once to ply his\ninformant with questions Having noted and copied an oral ritual among the\nswamp cultworshipers his men had arrested he besought the professor to\nremember as best he might the syllables taken down amongst the diabolist\nEskimos There then followed an exhaustive comparison of details and a moment\nof really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the virtual\nidentity of the phrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of\ndistance apart What in substance both the Eskimo wizards and the Louisiana\nswamppriests had chanted to their kindred idols was something very like this\nthe worddivisions being guessed at from traditional breaks in the phrase as\nchanted aloud",
    " Phnglui mglwnafh Cthulhu Rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagn ",
    "Legrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb for several among his\nmongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the\nwords meant This text as given ran something like this",
    "In his house at Rlyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming",
    "\nAnd now in response to a general urgent demand Inspector Legrasse related as\nfully as possible his experience with the swamp worshipers telling a story to\nwhich I could see my uncle attached profound significance It savored of the\nwildest dreams of mythmaker and theosophist and disclosed an astonishing\ndegree of cosmic imagination among such halfcastes and pariahs as might be\nleast expected to possess it",
    "On November 1st 1907 there had come to New Orleans police a frantic summons\nfrom the swamp and lagoon country to the south The squatters there mostly\nprimitive but goodnatured descendants of Lafittes men were in the grip of\nstark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night It\nwas voodoo apparently but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever\nknown and some of their women and children had disappeared since the\nmalevolent tomtom had begun its incessant beating far within the black\nhaunted woods where no dweller ventured There were insane shouts and\nharrowing screams soulchilling chants and dancing devilflames and the\nfrightened messenger added the people could stand it no more",
    "So a body of twenty police filling two carriages and an automobile had set\nout in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide At the end\nof the passable road they alighted and for miles splashed on in silence\nthrough the terrible cypress woods where day never came Ugly roots and\nmalignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them and now and then a pile\nof dank stones or fragments of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of\nmorbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous\nislet combined to create At length the squatter settlement a miserable\nhuddle of huts hove in sight and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster\naround the group of bobbing lanterns The muffled beat of tomtoms was now\nfaintly audible far far ahead and a curdling shriek came at infrequent\nintervals when the wind shifted A reddish glare too seemed to filter\nthrough the pale undergrowth beyond endless avenues of forest night Reluctant\neven to be left alone again each one of the cowed squatters refused point\nblank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship so Inspector\nLegrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of\nhorror that none of them had ever trod before",
    "The region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute\nsubstantially unknown and untraversed by white men There were legends of a\nhidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight in which dwelt a huge formless white\npolypous thing with luminous eyes and squatters whispered that batwinged\ndevils flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship it at midnight They\nsaid it had been there before DIberville before La Salle before the\nIndians and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods It was\nnightmare itself and to see it was to die But it made men dream and so they\nknew enough to keep away The present voodoo orgy was indeed on the merest\nfringe of this abhorred area but that location was bad enough hence perhaps\nthe very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the\nshocking sounds and incidents",
    "Only poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by Legrasses men\nas they plowed on through the black morass toward the red glare and the\nmuffled tomtoms There are vocal qualities peculiar to men and vocal\nqualities peculiar to beasts and it is terrible to hear the one when the\nsource should yield the other Animal fury and orgiastic license here whipped\nthemselves to demoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstasies that tore and\nreverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the\ngulfs of hell Now and then the less organized ululations would cease and\nfrom what seemed a welldrilled chorus of hoarse voices would rise in singsong\nchant that hideous phrase or ritual",
    " Phnglui mglwnafh Cthulhu Rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagn ",
    "Then the men having reached a spot where the trees were thinner came\nsuddenly in sight of the spectacle itself Four of them reeled one fainted\nand two were shaken into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy\nfortunately deadened Legrasse dashed swamp water on the face of the fainting\nman and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotized with horror",
    "In a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acres\nextent clear of trees and tolerably dry On this now leaped and twisted a\nmore indescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a Sime or an\nAngarola could paint Void of clothing this hybrid spawn were braying\nbellowing and writhing about a monstrous ringshaped bonfire in the center of\nwhich revealed by occasional rifts in the curtain of flame stood a great\ngranite monolith some eight feet in height on top of which incongruous in\nits diminutiveness rested the noxious carven statuette From a wide circle of\nten scaffolds set up at regular intervals with the flamegirt monolith as a\ncenter hung head downward the oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters\nwho had disappeared It was inside this circle that the ring of worshipers\njumped and roared the general direction of the mass motion being from left to\nright in endless bacchanale between the ring of bodies and the ring of fire",
    "It may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which\ninduced one of the men an excitable Spaniard to fancy he heard antiphonal\nresponses to the ritual from some far and unillumined spot deeper within the\nwood of ancient legendry and horror This man Joseph D Galvez I later met\nand questioned and he proved distractingly imaginative He indeed went so far\nas to hint of the faint beating of great wings and of a glimpse of shining\neyes and a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest treesbut I suppose he\nhad been hearing too much native superstition",
    "Actually the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration\nDuty came first and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel\ncelebrants in the throng the police relied on their firearms and plunged\ndeterminedly into the nauseous rout For five minutes the resultant din and\nchaos were beyond description Wild blows were struck shots were fired and\nescapes were made but in the end Legrasse was able to count some fortyseven\nsullen prisoners whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between\ntwo rows of policemen Five of the worshipers lay dead and two severely\nwounded ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by their fellow\nprisoners The image on the monolith of course was carefully removed and\ncarried back by Legrasse",
    "Examined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness the\nprisoners all proved to be men of a very low mixedblooded and mentally\naberrant type Most were seamen and a sprinkling of negroes and mulattoes\nlargely West Indians or Brava Portuguese from the Cape Verde Islands gave a\ncoloring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult But before many questions\nwere asked it became manifest that something far deeper and older than negro\nfetishism was involved Degraded and ignorant as they were the creatures held\nwith surprizing consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith",
    "They worshiped so they said the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there\nwere any men and who came to the young world out of the sky Those Old Ones\nwere gone now inside the earth and under the sea but their dead bodies had\ntold their secrets in dreams to the first man who formed a cult which had\nnever died This was that cult and the prisoners said it had always existed\nand always would exist hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the\nworld until the time when the great priest Cthulhu from his dark house in the\nmighty city of Rlyeh under the waters should rise and bring the earth again\nbeneath his sway Some day he would call when the stars were ready and the\nsecret cult would always be waiting to liberate him",
    "Meanwhile no more must be told There was a secret which even torture could\nnot extract Mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of\nearth for shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful few But these\nwere not the Great Old Ones No man had ever seen the Old Ones The carven\nidol was great Cthulhu but none might say whether or not the others were\nprecisely like him No one could read the old writing now but things were\ntold by word of mouth The chanted ritual was not the secretthat was never\nspoken aloud only whispered The chant meant only this In his house at\nRlyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming",
    "\nOnly two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged and the rest\nwere committed to various institutions All denied a part in the ritual\nmurders and averred that the killing had been done by Blackwinged Ones which\nhad come to them from their immemorial meetingplace in the haunted wood But\nof those mysterious allies no coherent account could ever be gained What the\npolice did extract came mainly from an immensely aged mestizo named Castro\nwho claimed to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of\nthe cult in the mountains of China",
    "Old Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of\ntheosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed\nThere had been eons when other Things ruled on the earth and They had had\ngreat cities Remains of Them he said the deathless Chinamen had told him\nwere still to be found as Cyclopean stones on islands in the Pacific They all\ndied vast epochs of time before man came but there were arts which could\nrevive Them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the\ncycle of eternity They had indeed come themselves from the stars and\nbrought Their images with Them",
    "These Great Old Ones Castro continued were not composed altogether of flesh\nand blood They had shapefor did not this starfashioned image prove it\nbut that shape was not made of matter When the stars were right They could\nplunge from world to world through the sky but when the stars were wrong\nThey could not live But although They no longer lived They would never\nreally die They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of Rlyeh\npreserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the\nstars and the earth might once more be ready for Them But at that time some\nforce from outside must serve to liberate Their bodies The spells that\npreserved Them intact likewise prevented Them from making an initial move and\nThey could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions of\nyears rolled by They knew all that was occurring in the universe for Their\nmode of speech was transmitted thought Even now They talked in Their tombs\nWhen after infinities of chaos the first men came the Great Old Ones spoke\nto the sensitive among them by molding their dreams for only thus could Their\nlanguage reach the fleshly minds of mammals",
    "Then whispered Castro those first men formed the cult around small idols\nwhich the Great Ones showed them idols brought in dim eras from dark stars\nThat cult would never die till the stars came right again and the secret\npriests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb to revive His subjects and\nresume His rule of earth The time would be easy to know for then mankind\nwould have become as the Great Old Ones free and wild and beyond good and\nevil with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and\nreveling in joy Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to\nshout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves and all the earth would flame\nwith a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom Meanwhile the cult by appropriate\nrites must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow forth the\nprophecy of their return",
    "In the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed Old Ones in dreams\nbut then something had happened The great stone city Rlyeh with its\nmonoliths and sepulchers had sunk beneath the waves and the deep waters\nfull of the one primal mystery through which not even thought can pass had\ncut off the spectral intercourse But memory never died and high priests said\nthat the city would rise again when the stars were right Then came out of the\nearth the black spirits of earth moldy and shadowy and full of dim rumors\npicked up in caverns beneath forgotten seabottoms But of them old Castro\ndared not speak much He cut himself off hurriedly and no amount of\npersuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this direction The size of the\nOld Ones too he curiously declined to mention Of the cult he said that he\nthought the center lay amid the pathless deserts of Arabia where Irem the\nCity of Pillars dreams hidden and untouched It was not allied to the\nEuropean witchcult and was virtually unknown beyond its members No book had\never really hinted of it though the deathless Chinamen said that there were\ndouble meanings in the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred which the\ninitiated might read as they chose especially the muchdiscussed couplet",
    "That is not dead which can eternal lie",
    "And with strange eons even death may die",
    "Legrasse deeply impressed and not a little bewildered had inquired in vain\nconcerning the historic affiliations of the cult Castro apparently had told\nthe truth when he said that it was wholly secret The authorities at Tulane\nUniversity could shed no light upon either cult or image and now the\ndetective had come to the highest authorities in the country and met with no\nmore than the Greenland tale of Professor Webb",
    "\nThe feverish interest aroused at the meeting by Legrasses tale corroborated\nas it was by the statuette is echoed in the subsequent correspondence of\nthose who attended although scant mention occurs in the formal publication of\nthe society Caution is the first care of those accustomed to face occasional\ncharlatanry and imposture Legrasse for some time lent the image to Professor\nWebb but at the latters death it was returned to him and remains in his\npossession where I viewed it not long ago It is truly a terrible thing and\nunmistakably akin to the dreamsculpture of young Wilcox",
    "That my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not wonder for\nwhat thoughts must arise upon hearing after a knowledge of what Legrasse had\nlearned of the cult of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not only the\nfigure and exact hieroglyphics of the swampfound image and the Greenland\ndevil tablet but had come in his dreams upon at least three of the precise\nwords of the formula uttered alike by Eskimo diabolists and mongrel\nLouisianans Professor Angells instant start on an investigation of the\nutmost thoroughness was eminently natural though privately I suspected young\nWilcox of having heard of the cult in some indirect way and of having\ninvented a series of dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncles\nexpense The dreamnarratives and cuttings collected by the professor were of\ncourse strong corroboration but the rationalism of my mind and the\nextravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the most\nsensible conclusions So after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and\ncorrelating the theosophical and anthropological notes with the cult narrative\nof Legrasse I made a trip to Providence to see the sculptor and give him the\nrebuke I thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man",
    "Wilcox still lived alone in the FleurdeLys Building in Thomas Street a\nhideous Victorian imitation of Seventeenth Century Breton architecture which\nflaunts its stuccoed front amidst the lovely Colonial houses on the ancient\nhill and under the very shadow of the finest Georgian steeple in America I\nfound him at work in his rooms and at once conceded from the specimens\nscattered about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic He will I\nbelieve be heard from sometime as one of the great decadents for he has\ncrystallized in clay and will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and\nfantasies which Arthur Machen evokes in prose and Clark Ashton Smith makes\nvisible in verse and in painting",
    "Dark frail and somewhat unkempt in aspect he turned languidly at my knock\nand asked me my business without rising When I told him who I was he\ndisplayed some interest for my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his\nstrange dreams yet had never explained the reason for the study I did not\nenlarge his knowledge in this regard but sought with some subtlety to draw\nhim out",
    "In a short time I became convinced of his absolute sincerity for he spoke of\nthe dreams in a manner none could mistake They and their subconscious\nresiduum had influenced his art profoundly and he showed me a morbid statue\nwhose contours almost made me shake with the potency of its black suggestion\nHe could not recall having seen the original of this thing except in his own\ndream basrelief but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly under his\nhands It was no doubt the giant shape he had raved of in delirium That he\nreally knew nothing of the hidden cult save from what my uncles relentless\ncatechism had let fall he soon made clear and again I strove to think of\nsome way in which he could possibly have received the weird impressions",
    "He talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion making me see with\nterrible vividness the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green stonewhose\nexpectancy the ceaseless halfmental calling from underground  Cthulhu\nfhtagn   Cthulhu fhtagn",
    "These words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead Cthulhus\ndreamvigil in his stone vault at Rlyeh and I felt deeply moved despite my\nrational beliefs Wilcox I was sure had heard of the cult in some casual\nway and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass of his equally weird reading\nand imagining Later by virtue of its sheer impressiveness it had found\nsubconscious expression in dreams in the basrelief and in the terrible\nstatue I now beheld so that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very\ninnocent one The youth was of a type at once slightly affected and slightly\nillmannered which I could never like but I was willing enough now to admit\nboth his genius and his honesty I took leave of him amicably and wish him\nall the success his talent promises",
    "The matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me and at times I had\nvisions of personal fame from researches into its origin and connections I\nvisited New Orleans talked with Legrasse and others of that oldtime raiding\nparty saw the frightful image and even questioned such of the mongrel\nprisoners as still survived Old Castro unfortunately had been dead for some\nyears What I now heard so graphically at first hand though it was really no\nmore than a detailed confirmation of what my uncle had written excited me\nafresh for I felt sure that I was on the track of a very real very secret\nand very ancient religion whose discovery would make me an anthropologist of\nnote My attitude was still one of absolute materialism as I wish it still\nwere  and I discounted with almost inexplicable perversity the coincidence\nof the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by Professor Angell",
    "One thing which I began to suspect and which I now fear I know  is that my\nuncles death was far from natural He fell on a narrow hill street leading up\nfrom an ancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels after a careless\npush from a negro sailor I did not forget the mixed blood and marine pursuits\nof the cultmembers in Louisiana and would not be surprized to learn of\nsecret methods and poison needles as ruthless and as anciently known as the\ncryptic rites and beliefs Legrasse and his men it is true have been let\nalone but in Norway a certain seaman who saw things is dead Might not the\ndeeper inquiries of my uncle after encountering the sculptors data have come\nto sinister ears I thing Professor Angell died because he knew too much or\nbecause he was likely to learn too much Whether I shall go as he did remains\nto be seen for I have learned much now",
    "",
    "If heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon it will be a total effacing of the\nresults of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelf\npaper It was nothing on which I would naturally have stumbled in the course\nof my daily round for it was an old number of an Australian journal Sydney\nBulletin for April 18 1925 It had escaped even the cutting bureau which had\nat the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncles\nresearch",
    "I had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called the\nCthulhu Cult and was visiting a learned friend of Paterson New Jersey the\ncurator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note Examining one day the\nreserve specimens roughly set on the storage shelves in a rear room of the\nmuseum my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers spread\nbeneath the stones It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned for my\nfriend has wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts and the picture\nwas a halftone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which\nLegrasse had found in the swamp",
    "Eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents I scanned the item in\ndetail and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length What it\nsuggested however was of portentous significance to my flagging quest and I\ncarefully tore it out for immediate action It read as follows",
    "MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA",
    "and Dead Man Found Aboard Tale of Desperate Battle and Deaths at Sea Rescued\nSeaman Refuses Particulars of Strange Experience Odd Idol Found in His\nPossession Inquiry to Follow",
    "\nThe Morrison Cos freighter Vigilant  bound from Valparaiso arrived this\nmorning at its wharf in Darling Harbour having in tow the battled and\ndisabled but heavily armed steam yacht Alert of Dunedin N Z which was\nsighted April 12th in S Latitude 34\u00c2\u00b0 21 W Longitude 152\u00c2\u00b0 17 with one\nliving and one dead man aboard",
    "The Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th and on April 2d was driven\nconsiderably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster\nwaves On April 12th the derelict was sighted and though apparently deserted\nwas found upon boarding to contain one survivor in a halfdelirious condition\nand one man who had evidently been dead for more than a week",
    "The living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin about a\nfoot in height regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney University the\nRoyal Society and the Museum in College Street all profess complete\nbafflement and which the survivor says he found in the cabin of the yacht in\na small carved shrine of common pattern",
    "This man after recovering his senses told an exceedingly strange story of\npiracy and slaughter He is Gustaf Johansen a Norwegian of some intelligence\nand had been second mate of the twomasted schooner Emma of Auckland which\nsailed for Callao February 20th with a complement of eleven men",
    "The Emma  he says was delayed and thrown widely south of her course by the\ngreat storm of March 1st and on March 22d in S Latitude 49\u00c2\u00b0 51\u00c2\u00b4 W\nLongitude 128\u00c2\u00b0 34\u00c2\u00b4 encountered the Alert  manned by a queer and evil\nlooking crew of Kanakas and halfcastes Being ordered peremptorily to turn\nback Capt Collins refused whereupon the strange crew began to fire savagely\nand without warning upon the schooner with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass\ncannon forming part of the yachts equipment",
    "The Emmas men showed fight says the survivor and though the schooner\nbegan to sink from shots beneath the waterline they managed to heave alongside\ntheir enemy and board her grappling with the savage crew on the yachts deck\nand being forced to kill them all the number being slightly superior because\nof their particularly abhorrent and desperate though rather clumsy mode of\nfighting",
    "Three of the Emmas men including Capt Collins and First Mate Green were\nkilled and the remaining eight under Second Mate Johansen proceeded to\nnavigate the captured yacht going ahead in their original direction to see if\nany reason for their ordering back had existed",
    "The next day it appears they raised and landed on a small island although\nnone is known to exist in that part of the ocean and six of the men somehow\ndied ashore though Johansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story\nand speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm",
    "Later it seems he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to manage\nher but were beaten about by the storm of April 2nd",
    "From that time till his rescue on the 12th the man remembers little and he\ndoes not even recall when William Briden his companion died Bridens death\nreveals no apparent cause and was probably due to excitement or exposure",
    "Cable advices from Dunedin report that the Alert was well known there as an\nisland trader and bore an evil reputation along the waterfront It was owned\nby a curious group of halfcastes whose frequent meetings and night trips to\nthe woods attracted no little curiosity and it had set sail in great haste\njust after the storm and earth tremors of March 1st",
    "Our Auckland correspondent gives the Emma and her crew an excellent\nreputation and Johansen is described as a sober and worthy man",
    "The admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter beginning\ntomorrow at which every effort will be made to induce Johansen to speak more\nfreely than he has done hitherto",
    "\nThis was all together with the picture of the hellish image but what a train\nof ideas it started in my mind Here were new treasuries of data on the\nCthulhu Cult and evidence that it had strange interests at sea as well as on\nland What motive prompted the hybrid crew to order back the Emma as they\nsailed about with their hideous idol What was the unknown island on which six\nof the Emmas crew had died and about which the mate Johansen was so\nsecretive What had the viceadmiraltys investigation brought out and what\nwas known of the noxious cult in Dunedin And most marvelous of all what deep\nand more than natural linkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now\nundeniable significance to the various turns of events so carefully noted by\nmy uncle",
    "March 1stour February 28th according to the International Date Linethe\nearthquake and storm had come From Dunedin the Alert and her noisome crew\nhad darted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned and on the other side of\nthe earth poets and artists had begun to dream of a strange dank Cyclopean\ncity whilst a young sculptor had molded in his sleep the form of the dreaded\nCthulhu March 23rd the crew of the Emma landed on an unknown island and\nleft six men dead and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a\nheightened vividness and darkened with dread of a giant monsters malign\npursuit whilst an architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly\ninto delirium And what of this storm of April 2ndthe date on which all\ndreams of the dank city ceased and Wilcox emerged unharmed from the bondage\nof strange fever What of all thisand of those hints of old Castro about the\nsunken starborn Old Ones and their coming reign their faithful cult and\ntheir mastery of dreams Was I tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors\nbeyond mans power to bear If so they must be horrors of the mind alone for\nin some way the second of April had put a stop to whatever monstrous menace\nhad begun its siege of mankinds soul",
    "\nThat evening after a day of hurried cabling and arranging I bade my host\nadieu and took a train for San Francisco In less than a month I was in\nDunedin where however I found that little was known of the strange cult\nmembers who had lingered in the old sea taverns Waterfront scum was far too\ncommon for special mention though there was vague talk about one inland trip\nthese mongrels had made during which faint drumming and red flame were noted\non the distant hills",
    "In Auckland I learned that Johansen had returned with yellow hair turned\nwhite after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at Sydney and had\nthereafter sold his cottage in West Street and sailed with his wife to his old\nhome in Oslo Of his stirring experience he would tell his friends no more\nthan he had told the admiralty officials and all they could do was to give me\nhis Oslo address",
    "After that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members of\nthe viceadmiralty court I saw the Alert  now sold and in commercial use\nat Circular Quay in Sydney Cove but gained nothing from its noncommittal\nbulk The crouching image with its cuttlefish head dragon body scaly wings\nand hieroglyphed pedestal was preserved in the Museum at Hyde Park and I\nstudied it long and well finding it a thing of balefully exquisite\nworkmanship and with the same utter mystery terrible antiquity and\nunearthly strangeness of material which I had noted in Legrasses smaller\nspecimen Geologists the curator told me had found it a monstrous puzzle\nfor they vowed that the world held no rock like it Then I thought with a\nshudder of what old Castro had told Legrasse about the primal Great Ones\nThey had come from the stars and had brought Their images with Them",
    "Shaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known I now\nresolved to visit Mate Johansen in Oslo Sailing for London I reembarked at\nonce for the Norwegian capital and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves\nin the shadow of the Egeberg",
    "Johansens address I discovered lay in the Old Town of King Harold\nHaardrada which kept alive the name of Oslo during all the centuries that the\ngreater city masqueraded as Christiania I made the brief trip by taxicab\nand knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and ancient building\nwith plastered front A sadfaced woman in black answered my summons and I\nwas stung with disappointment when she told me in halting English that Gustaf\nJohansen was no more",
    "He had not long survived his return said his wife for the doings at sea in\n1925 had broken him He had told her no more than he had told the public but\nhad left a long manuscriptof technical matters as he saidwritten in\nEnglish evidently in order to safeguard her from the peril of casual perusal\nDuring a walk through a narrow lane near the Gothenburg dock a bundle of\npapers falling from an attic window had knocked him down Two Lascar sailors\nat once helped him to his feet but before the ambulance could reach him he\nwas dead Physicians found no adequate cause for the end and laid it to heart\ntrouble and a weakened constitution",
    "I now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me\ntill I too am at rest accidentally or otherwise Persuading the widow\nthat my connection with her husbands technical matters was sufficient to\nentitle me to his manuscript I bore the document away and began to read it on\nthe London boat",
    "It was a simple rambling thinga naive sailors effort at a postfacto diary\nand strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage I can not attempt to\ntranscribe it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundance but I will tell\nits gist enough to show why the sound of the water against the vessels sides\nbecame so unendurable to me that I stopped my ears with cotton",
    "Johansen thank God did not know quite all even though he saw the city and\nthe Thing but I shall never sleep calmly again when I think of the horrors\nthat lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space and of those\nunhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which dream beneath the sea known and\nfavored by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them on the world\nwhenever another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to\nthe sun and air",
    "\nJohansens voyage had begun just as he told it to the viceadmiralty The\nfull force of that earthquakeborn tempest which must have heaved up from the\nseabottom the horrors that filled mens dreams Once more under control the\nship was making good progress when held up by the Alert on March 22nd and I\ncould feel the mates regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking Of\nthe swarthy cultfiends on the Alert he speaks with significant horror\nThere was some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their\ndestruction seem almost a duty and Johansen shows ingenuous wonder at the\ncharge of ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the\ncourt of inquiry Then driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht\nunder Johansens command the men sight a great stone pillar sticking out of\nthe sea and in S Latitude 47\u00c2\u00b0 9 W Longitude 126\u00c2\u00b0 43 come upon a\ncoastline of mingled mud ooze and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be\nnothing less than the tangible substance of earths supreme terrorthe\nnightmare corpsecity of Rlyeh that was built in measureless eons behind\nhistory by the vast loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars\nThere lay great Cthulhu and his hordes hidden in green slimy vaults and\nsending out at last after cycles incalculable the thoughts that spread fear\nto the dreams of the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come\non a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration All this Johansen did not\nsuspect but God knows he soon saw enough",
    "I suppose that only a single mountaintop the hideous monolithcrowned\ncitadel whereon great Cthulhu was buried actually emerged from the waters\nWhen I think of the extent of all that may be brooding down there I almost\nwish to kill myself forthwith Johansen and his men were awed by the cosmic\nmajesty of this dripping Babylon of elder demons and must have guessed\nwithout guidance that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet Awe at the\nunbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks at the dizzying height of the\ngreat carven monolith and at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues\nand basreliefs with the queer image found in the shrine on the Alert  is\npoignantly visible in every line of the mates frightened description",
    "Without knowing what futurism is like Johansen achieved something very close\nto it when he spoke of the city for instead of describing any definite\nstructure or building he dwells only on the broad impressions of vast angles\nand stone surfacessurfaces too great to belong to anything right or proper\nfor this earth and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs I mention\nhis talk about angles because it suggests something Wilcox had told me of\nhis awful dreams He had said that the geometry of the dreamplace he saw\nwas abnormal nonEuclidean and loathsomely redolent of spheres and\ndimensions apart from ours Now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing\nwhilst gazing at the terrible reality",
    "Johansen and his men landed at a sloping mudbank on this monstrous Acropolis\nand clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no\nmortal staircase The very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed through\nthe polarizing miasma welling out from this seasoaked perversion and twisted\nmenace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carven\nrock where a second glance showed concavity after the first showed convexity",
    "Something very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything\nmore definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen Each would have fled had\nhe not feared the scorn of the others and it was only halfheartedly that\nthey searchedvainly as it provedfor some portable souvenir to bear away",
    "It was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and\nshouted of what he had found The rest followed him and looked curiously at\nthe immense carved door with the now familiar squiddragon basrelief It was\nJohansen said like a great barndoor and they all felt that it was a door\nbecause of the ornate lintel threshold and jambs around it though they\ncould not decide whether it lay flat like a trapdoor or slantwise like an\noutside cellardoor As Wilcox would have said the geometry of the place was\nall wrong One could not be sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal\nhence the relative position of everything else seemed fantasmally variable",
    "Briden pushed at the stone in several places without result Then Donovan felt\nover it delicately around the edge pressing each point separately as he went\nHe climbed interminably along the grotesque stone moldingthat is one would\ncall it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontaland the men\nwondered how any door in the universe could be so vast Then very softly and\nslowly the acregreat panel began to give inward at the top and they saw\nthat it was balanced",
    "Donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb and rejoined\nhis fellows and everyone watched the queer recession of the monstrously\ncarven portal In this fantasy of prismatic distortion it moved anomalously in\na diagonal way so that all the rules of matter and perspective seemed upset",
    "The aperture was black with a darkness almost material That tenebrousness was\nindeed a positive quality  for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as\nought to have been revealed and actually burst forth like smoke from its eon\nlong imprisonment visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the\nshrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membranous wings The odor arising from\nthe newly opened depths was intolerable and at length the quickeared Hawkins\nthought he heard a nasty slopping sound down there Everyone listened and\neveryone was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and\ngropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway\ninto the tainted outside air of that poison city of madness",
    "Poor Johansens handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this Of the six\nmen who never reached the ship he thinks two perished of pure fright in that\naccursed instant The Thing can not be describedthere is no language for\nsuch abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy such eldritch contradictions\nof all matter force and cosmic order A mountain walked or stumbled God\nWhat wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad and poor Wilcox\nraved with fever in that telepathic instant The Thing of the idols the\ngreen sticky spawn of the stars had awaked to claim his own The stars were\nright again and what an ageold cult had failed to do by design a band of\ninnocent sailors had done by accident After vigintillions of years great\nCthulhu was loose again and ravening for delight",
    "Three men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned God rest\nthem if there be any rest in the universe They were Donovan Guerrera and\nAngstrom Parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over\nendless vistas of greencrusted rock to the boat and Johansen swears he was\nswallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldnt have been there an angle\nwhich was acute but behaved as if it were obtuse So only Briden and Johansen\nreached the boat and pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous\nmonstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated floundering at the\nedge of the water",
    "Steam had not been suffered to go down entirely despite the departure of all\nhands for the shore and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish\nrushing up and down between wheels and engines to get the Alert under way\nSlowly amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene she began to\nchurn the lethal waters whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore that was\nnot of earth the titan Thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like\nPolypheme cursing the fleeing ship of Odysseus Then bolder than the storied\nCyclops great Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with\nvast waveraising strokes of cosmic potency Briden looked back and went mad\nlaughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one\nnight in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously",
    "But Johansen had not given out yet Knowing that the Thing could surely\novertake the Alert until steam was fully up he resolved on a desperate\nchance and setting the engine for full speed ran lightninglike on deck and\nreversed the wheel There was a mighty eddying and foaming in the noisome\nbrine and as the steam mounted higher and higher the brave Norwegian drove\nhis vessel head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean\nfroth like the stern of a demon galleon The awful squidhead with writhing\nfeelers came nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht but Johansen drove\non relentlessly",
    "There was a bursting as of an exploding bladder a slushy nastiness as of a\ncloven sunfish a stench as of a thousand opened graves and a sound that the\nchronicler would not put on paper For an instant the ship was befouled by an\nacrid and blinding green cloud and then there was only a venomous seething\nastern whereGod in heaventhe scattered plasticity of that nameless sky\nspawn was nebulously recombining in its hateful original form whilst its\ndistance widened every second as the Alert gained impetus from its mounting\nsteam",
    "\nThat was all After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and\nattended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his\nside He did not try to navigate after the first bold flight for the reaction\nhad taken something out of his soul Then came the storm of April 2nd and a\ngathering of the clouds about his consciousness There is a sense of spectral\nwhirling through liquid gulfs of infinity of dizzying rides through reeling\nuniverses on a comets tail and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the\nmoon and from the moon back again to the pit all livened by a cachinnating\nchorus of the distorted hilarious elder gods and the green batwinged\nmocking imps of Tartarus",
    "Out of that dream came rescuethe Vigilant  the viceadmiralty court the\nstreets of Dunedin and the long voyage back home to the old house by the\nEgeberg He could not tellthey would think him mad He would write of what\nhe knew before death came but his wife must not guess Death would be a boon\nif only it could blot out the memories",
    "That was the document I read and now I have placed it in the tin box beside\nthe basrelief and the papers of Professor Angell With it shall go this\nrecord of minethis test of my own sanity wherein is pieced together that\nwhich I hope may never be pieced together again I have looked upon all that\nthe universe has to hold of horror and even the skies of spring and the\nflowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me But I do not think my\nlife will be long As my uncle went as poor Johansen went so I shall go I\nknow too much and the cult still lives",
    "Cthulhu still lives too I suppose again in that chasm of stone which has\nshielded him since the sun was young His accursed city is sunken once more\nfor the Vigilant sailed over the spot after the April storm but his\nministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around idolcapped\nmonoliths in lonely places He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst\nwithin his black abyss or else the world would by now be screaming with\nfright and frenzy Who knows the end What has risen may sink and what has\nsunk may rise Loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep and decay spreads\nover the tottering cities of men A time will comebut I must not and can not\nthink Let me pray that if I do not survive this manuscript my executors may\nput caution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye",
